## Finding Pairs

In the previous chapter you solved a few hand ranks using LINQ and refactored tests with method chains with the help of FluentAssertions.

In this chapter you'll continue with imperative and OOP style programming. Throughout the examples you'll be asked to refactor using functional programming. Later in this chapter, you'll learn about working with concurrency in C#.

Feel free to run tests as needed. **For example, after every code change.**

### Scoring Pairs

Continue to update the poker hand used throughout the workshop.

When this tests pass, move on to the next exercise.

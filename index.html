				<h2 id="creating-a-unit-test">Creating a unit test</h2>
<p>In this chapter you&#39;ll learn how to create simple unit tests with xUnit.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-card-test">Create a Card test</h3>
<p>Throughout this workshop you&#39;ll be using poker cards to learn new functional language features. In this exercise you&#39;ll create a new folder to hold unit tests and write your first unit test for a poker card. To keep things simple, in this workshop you&#39;ll use one project for all of your code. In a real-world app you would probably use a separate test project.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Create a Card test
</h4>

<p>Add a folder named Tests to your project.</p>
<p>In /Tests Add an empty class file named CardTests.cs</p>
<p>Make sure the CardTests class is defined as <strong>public</strong> so the test runner can see the test class.</p>
<pre><code>public class CardTests
</code></pre><p>In CardTests.cs add a new test method named CanCreateCard. Test methods in xUnit use the <code>[Fact]</code> attribute. You may need to import xUnit with a <code>using</code> statement, highlight Fact and press ctrl+. (control period), the press enter.</p>
<pre><code>[Fact]
public void CanCreateCard() { }
</code></pre><p>In the CanCreateCard method write a test that confirms that a new Card object can be created.</p>
<pre><code>var card = new Card();
Assert.NotNull(card);
</code></pre><p>There is no class defined yet, so you can consider this the first failing test. In the next exercise you&#39;ll create a Card object to satisfy this test.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="create-a-card-object">Create a Card object</h3>
<p>In this exercise you&#39;ll create a card object.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Create a Card object
</h4>

<p>In the root folder of your project, create a Card class named Card.cs.</p>
<p>Make the card class public.</p>
<pre><code>public class Card {}
</code></pre><p>This should be enough to satisfy the first unit test. Build the project (ctrl+shift+b), open Test  Explorer and click <strong>Run All</strong>. You should receive a green check-mark next to the CanCreateCard test.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/test-explorer-pass.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If the Test Explorer window is not visible, type Test Explorer in the quick launch box.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/test-explorer.jpg" alt=""></p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="complete-the-card-object">Complete the Card object</h3>
<p>A card must be able to represent a Suit and Value to be useful. In the next exercise you&#39;ll add some properties to the card and tests to insure a card has a Suit and Value when it is created.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: description
</h4>

<p>Give the card properties to hold a CardValue and CardSuit</p>
<pre><code>public class Card
{
    public CardValue Value { get; set; }
    public CardSuit Suit { get; set; }
}
</code></pre><p>Create enums for CardValue and CardSuit</p>
<pre><code>    // CardValue.cs
    public enum CardValue
    {
        Two = 2,
        Three,
        Four,
        Five,
        Six,
        Seven,
        Eight,
        Nine,
        Ten,
        Jack,
        Queen,
        King,
        Ace
    }

    // CardSuit.cs
    public enum CardSuit
    {
        Spades,
        Diamonds,
        Clubs,
        Hearts
    }
</code></pre><p>Change the CanCreateCard test so that a Card has a value when it is created, rename the test to CanCreateCardWithValue. Test to make sure the properties are NotNull.</p>
<pre><code>    [Fact]
    public void CanCreateCardWithValue() {

        var card = new Card();

        Assert.NotNull(card.Suit);
        Assert.NotNull(card.Value);
    }
</code></pre><p>Note that the test will pass even when no value was assigned. This is because enums have a default value.</p>
<p>To insure that a value is intentionally set, add a constructor to the Card that requires a Suit and Value.</p>
<pre><code>public class Card
{
    public Card(CardValue value, CardSuit suit)
    {
        Value = value;
        Suit = suit;
    }

    public CardValue Value { get; set; }
    public CardSuit Suit { get; set; }

}
</code></pre><p>Change the assertion so that it checks for a predetermined Suit and Value.</p>
<pre><code>var card = new Card(CardValue.Ace, CardSuit.Clubs);

Assert.Equal(CardSuit.Clubs, card.Suit);
Assert.Equal(CardValue.Ace, card.Value);
</code></pre><p>Now when a Card is created it must have its properties set to a value. In the next exercise you&#39;ll refactor the Card so that it is immutable, meaning that its properties cannot be changed once the object is created.</p>
<p>Re-run the test to verify that the test passes.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re using <strong>Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise edition</strong>. You can save time by enabling Live Unit Testing.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/enable-live-ut.jpg" alt=""></p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="describing-a-card">Describing a Card</h3>
<p>One positive aspect of C# programming is that both functional and OOP styles of programming are not mutually exclusive. In this exercise you&#39;ll override the inherited ToString method of the Card object and use it to describe the Card&#39;s values.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Override the inherited ToString method
</h4>

<p>Create a new test CanDescribeCard, this test should test a Card with the values of <code>CardValue.Ace</code> and <code>CardSuit.Spades</code>. The ToString method should return <code>&quot;Ace of Spades&quot;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[Fact]
public void CanDescribeCard()
{
      var card = new Card(CardValue.Ace, CardSuit.Spades);

      Assert.Equal(&quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, card.ToString());

}
</code></pre><p>Run the test to verify that it fails.</p>
<p>Next, update the Card object to make the test pass. Override the ToString method on the Card class and utilize the string interpolation syntax to write out the Card&#39;s description.</p>
<pre><code>    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $&quot;{Value} of {Suit}&quot;;
    }
</code></pre><p>Re-run the test to verify that the test passes.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="describing-a-card-refactor">Describing a Card, refactor</h3>
<p>The ToString method is a simple, single line of code that returns a value. In this exercise you&#39;ll use an expression-bodied member to reduce the amount of code further into a concise expression.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Convert ToString to an expression-bodied member
</h4>

<p>Find the ToString method of the Card class. Remove the braces {} from the method, and replace the <code>return</code> statement with a lambda arrow =&gt;. The arrow implies that the method will return a value, and the result is a much simpler syntax. </p>
<p>This will reduce the method to a simple one line statement. </p>
<pre><code>    public override string ToString() =&gt; $&quot;{Value} of {Suit}&quot;;
</code></pre><p>Re-run the test to verify that the test passes.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>


<h3 id="immutable-card-object">Immutable Card object</h3>
<p>In functional programming immutable objects are used to reduce complexity and avoid unintended changes in state. An immutable object&#39;s state cannot be modified after it is created, lowering the risk of side-effects.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Modify the Card to make it immutable
</h4>

<p>In C# 6 or higher, backing fields and explicit readonly property declarations are not needed. By simply removing the <code>set</code> operator from a property will make it a read-only property.</p>
<p>In the Card class, remove the <code>set</code> declarations from each property.</p>
<pre><code>public class Card
{
    public Card(CardValue value, CardSuit suit)
    {
        Value = value;
        Suit = suit;
    }

    public CardValue Value { get; }
    public CardSuit Suit { get; }

    public override string ToString() =&gt; $&quot;{Value} of {Suit}&quot;;
}
</code></pre><p>Now the properties can only be set during the object&#39;s initialization.</p>
<p>Re-run the test to verify that the test passes.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>In this chapter you created a simple object and used some functional aspects of C#. By using expression bodied-members, the ToString method was reduced to a single expression. The Card class was made immutable by using the objects constructor and removing the <code>set</code> declarations from the object. In the Card object, both OOP and functional programming were used in a single class.</p>
<p>This chapter also outlined the basics of writing and running unit tests. Now that you&#39;re comfortable with running unit tests, you will not be instructed to run tests after this point, instead feel free to run them as needed throughout the remainder of the next chapters.</p>

				<h2 id="a-poker-hand">A poker hand</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter you created a simple object and used some functional aspects of C#.</p>
<p>In this chapter you&#39;ll start with imperative and OOP style programming. Throughout the examples you&#39;ll be asked to refactor using functional programming. This will help identify where to find balance between the two styles. As the this guide progresses, instructions will become less detailed so that you can explore your on your own.</p>
<p>Now that you&#39;re comfortable with running unit tests, you will not be instructed to run tests after this point, instead feel free to run them as needed. <strong>For example, after every code change.</strong></p>
<h3 id="create-a-hand">Create a Hand</h3>
<p>The poker hand will be used throughout the workshop. The Hand will represent a player&#39;s hand of cards. For this workshop a five card hand will be scored using imperative and functional programming.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Create the HandTests
</h4>

<p>Create a test class named HandTests in the /Tests folder. Make sure HandTests is public.</p>
<p>Use the following tests to create a Hand class that has a Cards property and a Draw method.</p>
<pre><code>    [Fact]
    public void CanCreateHand()
    {
        var hand = new Hand();
        Assert.False(hand.Cards.Any());

    public void CanHandDrawCard()
    {
        var card = new Card(CardValue.Ace, CardSuit.Spades);
        var hand = new Hand();

        hand.Draw(card);

        Assert.Equal(hand.Cards.First(), card);
    }
</code></pre><p>Create a Hand class that satisfies the tests.</p>
<pre><code>public class Hand
{
    public Hand()
    {
        Cards = new List&lt;Card&gt;();
    }
    public List&lt;Card&gt; Cards { get;}

    public void Draw(Card card)
    {
        Cards.Add(card);
    }

}
</code></pre><p>The Hand class will hold a players hand of cards. In the next exercises you will be scoring the Hand of cards from the Cards property in the Hand class.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="getting-the-high-card">Getting the high card</h3>
<p>In a game where all players hands are a equal in rank, the winner is decided by comparing the highest card in their hands. Add a HighCard method to the Hand that returns the highest CardValue in the hand. </p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Score the high card
</h4>

<p>Below is a test method you can use to validate your HighCard method.</p>
<pre><code>    [Fact]
    public void CanGetHighCard()
    {
        var hand = new Hand();
        hand.Draw(new Card(CardValue.Seven, CardSuit.Spades));
        hand.Draw(new Card(CardValue.Ten, CardSuit.Clubs));
        hand.Draw(new Card(CardValue.Five, CardSuit.Hearts));
        hand.Draw(new Card(CardValue.King, CardSuit.Hearts));
        hand.Draw(new Card(CardValue.Two, CardSuit.Hearts));
        Assert.Equal(CardValue.King, hand.HighCard().Value);
    }

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="hand-rankings">Hand rankings</h3>
<p>In the previous exercise, you determined the high card. Now add a HandRank GetHandRank method that will return the Hand&#39;s HandRank.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">

<p>In the previous chapter you solved more hand ranks using LINQ and refactored with the yield keyword to create a custom LINQ-like extension method.</p>
<p>In this chapter you&#39;ll refactor to use a more functional approach to scoring a hand.</p>

    <b>Exercise</b>: Refactor with Pure Functions
</h4>

<p>Create a new public static class named FiveCardPokerScorer</p>
<p>Open Hand.cs and move the scoring functionality to FiveCardPokerScorer.cs. Because the functionality will be external to the data, the funcitons will need to be modified to accept the data as a parameter. In addtion, this will bring the application closer in-line with functional programming because the new functions are considered &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>public static class FiveCardPokerScorer
{
    public static Card HighCard(IEnumerable&lt;Card&gt; cards) =&gt; cards.Aggregate((highCard, nextCard) =&gt; nextCard.Value &gt; highCard.Value ? nextCard : highCard);

    private static bool HasFlush(IEnumerable&lt;Card&gt; cards) =&gt; cards.All(c =&gt; cards.First().Suit == c.Suit);

# Quick Start Guide Template

This is a template for building quick start guides.

## Setup

Windows users install `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` first.

```
$npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

Start by running `npm install` to install this templateâ€™s dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

And then run `gulp` to launch the guide in your browser:

```
$ gulp
```

Gulp starts up a development server and launches the quick start guide in it. Gulp also watches for changes to files in the `src` folder (including the chapter Markdown files), and refreshes the site in your browser automatically.
